   - Fetches user details, repositories, stars, and commit counts using the GitHub API.
   - Displays the most-used programming language based on repositories.

2. **Blog Integration**:
   - Parses an XML feed to display the latest blog articles.
   - Supports sorting and filtering of articles.

3. **Dynamic User Profile**:
   - Customizable avatar, nickname, and achievements.
   - Real-time badges and stats fetched from APIs.

4. **Interactive UI**:
   - Buttons and links to navigate to user social profiles and repositories.
   - Dynamically styled components for a modern look.

## Application Structure

### Components

1. **`App`**:
   - The main component that fetches and displays data.
   - Uses React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects.

2. **`SteamDetails`**:
   - A wrapper component for the UI layout and design.

### Utility Functions

1. **`getLevelByGPQ`**:
   - A utility function to calculate user levels based on their GitHub stats.

2. **`fetchData`**:
   - Fetches GitHub user information and repositories.
   - Calculates total stars, commits, and programming language usage.

3. **`fetchArticles`**:
   - Fetches and parses an XML feed to extract blog articles.
   - Sorts and displays the four latest articles.

---

## API Integration

### GitHub API
- **Endpoints Used**:
  1. `https://api.github.com/users/{username}` - Fetches user details.
  2. `https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos` - Fetches repositories.
  3. `https://api.github.com/search/commits` - Fetches total commits.

- **Headers**:
  ```json
  {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <github_api_key>",
    "Accept": "application/vnd.github.cloak-preview"
  }
  ```

### Blog Feed
- **Endpoint**: 
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yagasaki7K/website-yagasaki/refs/heads/main/article.xml`

- **Parsing**:
  - Uses the `DOMParser` to parse the XML.
  - Extracts `title`, `link`, `pubDate`, and `description` fields.

This can be removed or changed to whatever XML is needed, following the practices of each blog/site.
